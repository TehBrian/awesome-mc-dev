# awesome-mc-dev

The following is a lame excuse of an Awesome list; you might notice
that the logo is absent. This document's actual purpose is to prevent
me from having to constantly Google the frameworks and libraries that
I use on a daily basis by providing links to those projects in one
self-contained document.

This list is less of a "cool projects that you should look into" and
more of a "amazing projects that I use on a daily basis and could
not live without."
